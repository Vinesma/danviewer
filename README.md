# Danviewer

Mobile app built with React Native for viewing danbooru galeries.

## How it works

Input the tags* you want to search** and Danviewer will take care of the rest!

\* tags need to match danbooru's tags, for example 'girls und panzer' will not work but 'girls_und_panzer' will match, they can be uppercase or lowercase however.

\*\* Max of 2 tags at the moment, I have plans to increase this with some clever API requests but I don't know how viable it could be.

## Development

The project is developed with React Native using `expo-cli`.

To set up your development environment:

* `npm install -g expo-cli`

* Get the expo client on `Android` or `iOS`.

* Run `npm install` to fetch all dependencies.

* Run `npm start` in the main project folder, in this case `danviewer/`.

* Scan the QR code with the mobile app.

Develop away!
